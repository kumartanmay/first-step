        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://www.inkredo.in">Inkredo</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am Kumar Tanmay from New Delhi. Have been residing here since 2007. I participated in cohort 11. I grew up in Dalhousie, Burnpur, and Ranchi. I am having fun with startups since 2008. I am still trying. I am fascinated by the flows of money and its behaviour with changing income groups.</p>
        <p>
          Shifting to writing, I used to maintain a personal diary during my childhood days but abandoned it just before college because it became too sensitive to handle - usual teenage tantrums and parents :-).  I took up writing diary again in late 2019 and the pandemic gave me enough room to express myself. I am trying to be a good writer in my own eyes. I want to write the deepest of my thoughts in simple and short sentences. Often my thoughts are so broken that I find it funny when I read them later. Penning down on paper doesn't give me the luxury of editing my thoughts and rearranging them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love reading non-fiction, especially business memoirs, biographies, psychology and philosophy. </p></td>
